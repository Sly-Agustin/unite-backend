# unite-backend

Basic project for an uni assigment. The idea is creating a simple API that handles logins, requests, files, etc. 

## Requirements
- Nodejs v18.15.0
- NPM v9.6.2

## Installation
- Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
- Create an `.env` file: the server needs some environment variables, use the `.env.sample` file to see what do you need and set the `.env` accordingly

## Local development
To test the app run the command `npm run build` and `npm run start`
